In this project, you are asked to implement the SOCKS4 firewall protocol in the application layer of the OSI model.

SOCKS is similar to a proxy (i.e. intermediary-program) that acts as both server and client for the purpose of making request on behalf of other clients. Because the SOCKS protocol is independent of application protocols, it can be used for many different services: telnet, ftp, www, etc.

There are two types of the SOCKS operations (i.e. CONNECT and BIND). You have to implement both of them.

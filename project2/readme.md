In this project, you are asked to design 3 kinds of server:

1. Design a concurrent connection-oriented server. This server allows one client connect to it, and supports all performance in project 1.


2. Design the server of the chat-like systems, called remote working systems (rws). In this system, users can meet with/work with/talk to/make friends with other users. Basically, this system supports all functions, as you did in project 1. In addition, all users can see what all on-line users are working.


3. You need to use the single-process concurrent paradigm to design this server.
Design the rws server using the concurrent connection-oriented paradigm with shared memory.
